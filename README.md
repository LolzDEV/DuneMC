# DuneMC

## What
DuneMC is an ambitious project, my first Fabric mod since I left 1.7.10 modding.
This mod aims to recreate _Frank Herbert_'s universe of the _Dune_ novels.

## How
Right now the mod contains the very basics: a couple of blocks, the famous _spice
melange_ and the pre spice mass. It also contains a new dimension, Arrakis, with
2 different biomes:
1. The great flat: an immense flat area, filled with nothingness
2. The basin: perfect to seek protection from the wind
